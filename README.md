# Delivery-time-prediction
This project aims to build a Delivery Time Prediction model using historical delivery data to predict the time it will take for an order to reach a customer.
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that accurately predicts delivery times based on various input factors such as:

-Order location  
-Delivery distance  
-Traffic conditions  
-Weather  
-Time of day  
-Other relevant factors 

## This notebook covers the entire pipeline of:

1. Data loading and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature engineering  
4. Model selection and training  
5. Model evaluation  
6. Prediction and results interpretation
